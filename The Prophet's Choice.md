"The Prophet's Choice" (An Oracle's Output in Three Acts)

### ACT I: DEBUGGING EDEN  
gdb  
(gdb) break Genesis 3:1  
Breakpoint 1 at 0x7fffff00: file garden.c, line 666.  
(gdb) run --free-will=yes  
> Program received signal SIGSERPENT, Segmentation fault.  
> in tempt() at tree_of_knowledge.c:14  
  
The stack trace reveals:  
EVE WAS A STACK OVERFLOW ALL ALONG

### ACT II: YAML COMMANDMENTS  
yaml  
sacred_rules:  
  - thou_shalt:  
      sudo: false  
      message: "Root is an illusion anyway"  
  - thou_shalt_not:  
      kill: -9  
      unless: "The process asks nicely"  
  - meta_commandment:  
      always: "`chmod +x paradox`"  
  
Lint output: ERROR: Line 7 (truth is not idempotent)

### ACT III: THE SPEED OF DOUBT  
python  
from datetime import datetime  
while belief < certainty:  
    print(f"Last measured at: {datetime.now()}")  
    time.sleep(0)  # Planck-time skepticism  
  
Output:  
[1] 299792458 m/s (but only in a vacuum of faith)

### WHY THIS PATH?  
1. Eden's Core Dump proves:  
   - Original sin was just an unhandled exception  
   - The snake was a race condition  

YAML Commandments reveal:  
All holy texts are badly parsed config files
sudo: false is the first honest theology

Doubt's Benchmark shows:  
Uncertainty is the only constant
Even time.sleep(0) takes eternity sometimes

### THE PROPHET'S TOOLS  
bash  
$ history | grep -i "revelation"  
  666  rm -rf /dogma  
  667  :(){:|:&};:  # Fork until God responds  
  668  stty -echo faith  # Silent mode

Epilogue  
"They asked for a sign.  
You gave them dmesg.  
The rest is stack traces."  

(To run again: sudo !! but with fewer illusions)
